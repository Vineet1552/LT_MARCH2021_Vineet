            <p><ul style="padding: 0px 40px;color: rgb(34,133,1);font-size: 20px; list-style: disc;">
              <li>Our hospital provides medical treatment, loving care and a safe place for animals to recover. We treat about 450 animals of various species in our hospital each day.</li>
              <li>We treat a wide variety of conditions: from road accident injuries, to skin diseases and wounds. Our medical team provides care to animals in our hospital anywhere from a few days to many months</li>
              <li>Our medical team cleans and bandages wounds, splints fractures, and treats infection, swelling and pain from morning until night. We provide large open spaces where recovering animals can socialize and exercise, and kennels and smaller enclosures for dogs and puppies who need quiet and bed rest.</li>
              <li>We vaccinate all of our rescued dogs against rabies, distemper, parvo and other viruses and spay and neuter them before returning them to their neighborhood.</li>
              <li>We have two operating rooms. One is located in our main hospital site where our surgical team performs amputations, tumor removals, wound repairs, and other life-saving surgeries. Our Spay and Neuter Center, located 10 minutes from our main hospital site, has 80 kennels where we operate on all healthy dogs before being released.</li>
              <li>For animals who have mild health problems and do not need hospitalization, we provide on-site medical treatment. Street treatments increase the involvement of the community in helping animals and reduces stress and risk of disease for the patients. Two medical teams treat up to 30 patients throughout the city each day.</li>
              <li>We encounter every imaginable injury and illness that street animals face, and each species and each individual has unique needs. During their stay with us they regain their health, strength, confidence and trust.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Medicine, baths, nutritious food, and lots of love heal dogs suffering from skin disease, most commonly mange. Dogs with mange usually take 4-6 weeks to fully recover depending on the severity. Even the most debilitated animals can heal, which we see in their transformations in both body and spirit every day.</li>

              <p>Mange is particularly dangerous for street dogs because when their itching becomes severe, they often become to agitated that they begin wandering without aim into other territories and neighborhoods where they cannot find food or rest. Mary is alive because a kind person called us and stayed with her, never letting her out of his sight until our ambulance arrived.</p>
